App Suggestions

Feel free to add any app ideas you have on here for our term project.

1. 'Jarvis' App - use a bunch of APIs to inform user of weather, calendar items, news, trending hashtags etc, based on location and time.

2, Recipe App - takes a list of ingredients that you have and tells you any appropriate recipes you can make. Includes nutritional information.
