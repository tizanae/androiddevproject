App Suggestions

Feel free to add any app ideas you have on here for our term project.

1. 'Jarvis' App - use a bunch of APIs to inform user of weather, calendar items, news, trending hashtags etc, based on location and time.

2, Recipe App - takes a list of ingredients that you have and tells you any appropriate recipes you can make. Includes nutritional information.

3. Financial App - dynamically budget according to current spending trends and needs? link to bank account and debit card?

4. Fitness app - Not sure yet

5. Bowling app - access to scores, lane information, balls, score and pin tracking, etc

6. Meal Prepping - Determine recipes and meals based on nutritional needs and health information. Also includes option to plan for families.

7. Social buzz - use social media APIs to suggest restaurants, activities, night life spots based on location and time. e.g. check facebook, twitter and foursquare #hastags for location you're in within a certain range of time and make suggestions from most to least popular.

8. App like craigslist or offer up. We either provide in app payments or connect to something like venmo. Also, we take both people's locations and find them a secure parking lot or place to make their transaction, that is in between them?

9. Medical App - We provide a database for the doctors to store their patients medical records (not sure how secure we can make it, but we basically have to lock this down), and we allow doctors to access this. We can also provide appointment management with this. 

10. Class.ify? - We provide a platform for students to rate college classes/professors, share notes with other students for those classrooms, and discuss meeting up and studying for those classes?
